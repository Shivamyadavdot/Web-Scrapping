# Web-Scrapping of yahoo finance
This is a Python script that scrapes key financial data from the Yahoo Finance website for a specific stock symbol entered by the user. 
It opens a web browser using the Chrome driver, retrieves the source code of the webpage, and creates a BeautifulSoup object to navigate and search the HTML structure of the webpage. 
The script then extracts the name, price, change, and key financial statistics of the stock and stores them in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
